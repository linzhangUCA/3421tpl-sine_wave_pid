# PID Controlled Sinusoidal Velocity Regulation 

## Objetives
- Practice **P**roportional **I**ntegral **D**erivative control policy to regulate a motor's velocity.
- Collect wheel's motion data.
- Evaluate controller performance.

## Requirements
Finish the provided python scripts, collect data and assess your controller's performance. 

### 1. (70%) Collect PID Control Data
Complete [pid_sine_test.py](pid_sine_test.py) to achieve following requests.
1. (10%) Tune PID gains
2. (20%) Plot the data points from last successful scan under the polar coordinate system. Only plot the data points within 0 to 1 meter range.

#### Hints
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) installation
```console
# Run following line in terminal
pip install matplotlib --break-system-packages
```

### 2. (30%) Controller Performance Evaluation
