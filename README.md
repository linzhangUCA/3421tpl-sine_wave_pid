# PID Controlled Sinusoidal Velocity Regulation 

## Objetives
- Practice **P**roportional **I**ntegral **D**erivative control policy to regulate a motor's velocity.
- Collect wheel's motion data.
- Evaluate controller performance.

## Requirements
Find the sections wrapped by the following comments. 
```python
### START CODING HERE ###

### END CODING HERE ###
```
Finish the provided python scripts to achieve the following goals. 

### 1. (60%) Collect PID Control Data
Complete [pid_sine_test.py](pid_sine_test.py) to achieve following requests.
1. (50%) Tune PID gains. Find the best combination of the 3 gains.
2. (10%) Store the data from the best performed model by uncommenting the last 3 lines in [pid_sine_test.py](pid_sine_test.py).

#### Hints
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) installation
```console
# Run following line in terminal
pip install matplotlib --break-system-packages
```

### 2. (40%) Controller Performance Evaluation
